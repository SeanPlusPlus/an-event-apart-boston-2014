# Understanding Web Design

Day One, first talk.

Jeffrey, Zeldman

### "It's interactive if it's on the internet"

- an art director tells our speaker while judging art direction of sites
- something is wrong with that! hmmmm ...
- a like button does not constitute interaction
- web design not sub species of ad or marketing
- forcing biggest brands to think of website as afterthought
- this is b/c ad companies wanna sell media space
- it is hard enough to create great design when everyone on your team agrees


### The Mystery Of Web Design

- only when our partners understand what we do ... do we get the autonomy to do what we want
- understanding the business of a client bigger than technical expertise
