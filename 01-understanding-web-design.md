# Understanding Web Design

Day One, first talk

Jeffrey, Zeldman


### "It's interactive if it's on the internet"

- an art director tells our speaker while judging art direction of sites
- something is wrong with that! hmmmm ...
- a like button does not constitute interaction
- web design not sub species of ad or marketing
- forcing biggest brands to think of website as afterthought
- this is b/c ad companies wanna sell media space
- it is hard enough to create great design when everyone on your team agrees


### The Mystery Of Web Design

- only when our partners understand what we do ... do we get the autonomy to do what we want
- understanding the business of a client bigger than technical expertise 
- always be doing something personal, break out from rigid job thinking


### How to let our bosses and clients know what matters

- webbys and art directors club for celebs and advertising
- major web companies speak to us but not for us


### Anything that gets in the way of what our user wants to do, is bad design

- we are strategists, not waiters
- think about user and goals, not how to technicially achieve something no one should be doing in the first place
- ppl fantasize the tech aspects of this work
- *we do not design for browsers, we do not design for tablets, we design for people*
- web design is not book or poster design, it is not game design
- it is more like type design / architecture ... creating planes and grids then steps away
- a great site makes interaction easy
- they guide you subtly - never passive - looks that way tho
- great design can be invisible or in your face
- always delights and makes experience better


### How do we turn colleagues into allies

- every day you come to work is a day to impress people
- do not wait to be invited to do you job
- be on time; be assertive; volunteer;
