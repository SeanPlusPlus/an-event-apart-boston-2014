Understanding Web Design
===

"It's interactive if it's on the internet"

- an art director tells our speaker while judging art direction of sites
- something is wrong with that! hmmmm ...
- a like button does not constitute a like button
- web design not sub species of ad or marketing
- forcing biggest brands to think of website as afterthought
- this is b/c ad companies wanna sell media space
- it's hard enough to create great design when everyone on your team agrees
