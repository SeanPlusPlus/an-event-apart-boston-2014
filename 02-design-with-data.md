# Design with data

- "design is no longer a killer differentiator"
- instincts are experiments, data is proof
- it can be easy to think of data/content as not part of our job
- we approach projects from design or development perspective - not asking "why" enough
- "research is formalized curiosoity"
- "nobody has an excuse to make an uninformed decision anymore"
- "designers go from decorators to problem solvers"
- stop decorating and start designing
- if you can not act on a metric, it is a vanity stat
- it is not the system - but the heavily designed process
