Day One, second talk

- instincts are experiments, data is proof
- it can be easy to think of data/content as not part of our job
- we approach projects from design or development perspective - not asking "why" enough
- "design is no longer a killer differentiator"
- "research is formalized curiosoity"
- "nobody has an excuse to make an uninformed decision anymore"
- "designers go from decorators to problem solvers"


### Stop decorating and start designing

- if you can not act on a metric, it is a vanity stat
- it is not the system - but the heavily designed process


### We have all started a client project with nothing ...

- think about your packet of assets
- bring real images


### Iterative working

- be flexible with your design
- app to check out: crazy egg, optimizely


### Content hierarchy over content placement

- key for responsive design
