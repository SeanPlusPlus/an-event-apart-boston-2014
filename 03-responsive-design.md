### Henry Ford

- rad ideas, for the time ... but now ...
- separating design and dev an old school assembly line hold-over
- we are not far off from bringing this all together more


### Framework

- not process (efficient, same output every time, no surprises)
- framework has constraints


### Waterfall to agile in six easy steps

- pass the batton: stay a little longer and start a little earlier than expected (areas of overlap)
- more togehter time (increase that above step)
- be on project as long as you can
- appropriate tapering
- focal points: all start and end together (from start to ship)
- rinse and repeat (leads to traditional agile)


### Modern web design process

- plan; research (just go out there and talk to consumers of this project); hypothesize
- inventory (take a peak at the "The Elements of Content Strategy"); 
- performance budget as design tool (this is a really friggin interesting part - get his slides and review this)
- sketching; explore ideas roughly and quickly ("Responsive Design Workflow"); 
- element collages:
  - i like this very much; further reading:

- prototyping; prototype one starts very very very basic, and all steps very minimal
- assemble (should be the easy part); prep for service!!!
- it is really easy to work through well thoughtout preset ideas


### Fluid grid, flexible images, media queries

- responsive not hard
- brings up a lot of things tho!
  - availability of content
  - performance
  - hierarchy
  - #rwd as a reminder
