Day two, tenth talk

### Multidevice world
 
- both individually and with our circle around us
- on average, ppl change devices 21 times per hr
- 90% accomplish tasks across multiple devices
- 67% start shopping on one device then move to another
- spreading tasks across devices, but devices are silos
- as such we come up with hacks
- search / email / text glue this together
- not entirely new, we used a remote to bridge this gap
- now chromecast hacks this

### Sequenced behavior

- picking up where i left off
- take pic on phone of screen and then app figures out how to fetch that page and save state

### WebRTC / WebSockets / Bluetooth LE

- simple hand shake and discovery
- peer to peer
- we can exchange content and control
- *sync not just verbs, but also nouns*

### But screens are distracting and not fun!

- lets design for people and not for screens
- our obligation to bend tech to our life and not vice versa

- *not a challenge of technology, a challenge of imagination*
- there is magic in the gaps
  - moving not just data
  - but also actions
- and magic is moving target

- but never try to our mouse the mouse

### Anything that can be connected will be connected

- everyday objects are digital gadgets
- physical things have digital avatars
- what happens when your car is your friend on facebook, or you follow your house on twitter
- but connected devices do not always say nice things
- *anything that can be hacked will be hacked*

### Software is embedded with values

- the code I write supports my values
- more and more personal data is gonna be controlled
- our business is about guiding behavior
