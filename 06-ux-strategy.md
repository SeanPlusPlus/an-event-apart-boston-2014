*Design: the rendering of intent*

Every site, kiosk, app has some content and some design in it.

Design is intentional.

No way to have great UX without great design and great content.

Delivering the content is as important as the content itself.

We use strategy to achieve a desired outcome.

If a strategy can not predict an outcome, it is broken.

Web strategy similar to Business / University / Government strategy.


### Seducible Moment

- a type of advertising that mutha fuckin works
- but it is hard
- does not scale
- built into the experience


### Metered paywall

- demands excellent content
- nyt rocked it
- in app purchases similar

... Really solid talk ... Hard to take notes on though ... Just listening to the flow.

... Wonderful day one!
