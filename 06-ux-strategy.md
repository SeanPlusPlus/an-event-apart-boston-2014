*Design: the rendering of intent*

Every site, kiosk, app has some content and some design in it.

Design is intentional.

No way to have great UX without great design and great content.

Delivering the content is as important as the content itself.

We use strategy to achieve a desired outcome.

If a strategy can not predict an outcome, it is broken.

Web strategy similar to Business / University / Government strategy.
