### Screens are starting to eat the planet

- last year there was 1/2 sq. ft. of gorilla glass made for every human
- it is THE medium between us and user
- learn this shit, yo! know your screen.


### Web devs still focused on screens for PCs

- tablets and phones meteorically surpassed pc sales in 2011
- form factor of 3-5 in hand held device is huuuuge for designing too


### Output

- from laptop to smartphone 100 to 200 px per inch
- now hard to see one pixel with human eye, now like 500+ px per in
- so many pixels gnar crammed into a very small screen
- use media queries to find not only screen size, but also rez
- 50% of downstream traffic is youtube and netflix - screens more widescreen as such
- 16:9 is aspect ratio of all major mobile devices sold
- use media queries to design specifically for aspect ratio


### Input

- multiple modes of input for pretty much every device
- screen size poor proxy for input
- media queries level four


### Posture

- how are ppl interacting with i/o capabilities
- this shit is kind of blowing my mind here. great talk.
- take a peak at media query for light level
- design to human scale and enivoronment, not necessarily screen width
