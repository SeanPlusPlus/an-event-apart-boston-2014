### Multidevice world
 
- both individually and with our circle around us
- on average, ppl change devices 21 times per hr
- 90% accomplish tasks across multiple devices
- 67% start shopping on one device then move to another
- spreading tasks across devices, but devices are silos
- as such we come up with hacks
- search / email / text glue this together
- not entirely new, we used a remote to bridge this gap
- now chromecast hacks this

### Sequenced behavior

- picking up where i left off
- take pic on phone of screen and then app figures out how to fetch that page and save state

### WebRTC / WebSockets / Bluetooth LE

- simple hand shake and discovery
- peer to peer
- we can exchange content and control
- *sync not just verbs, but also nouns*
